Introduction
============

**GIMS** stands for Global Information Management System on Environment
and Health.

This project, initiated by the `World Health Organization (WHO) Public Health
and Environment Department <http://www.who.int/phe/en/>`_, aims at helping
gather data in a decentralized yet structured way so as to be able to perform
meaningful analysis that help decision makers initiate appropriate actions
on the field.

For further information, see the `gimsinitiative.org website
<http://www.gimsinitiative.org/about>`_ and take a look at the `short
presentation <http://dev.gimsinitiative.org/intro>`_ of what this web
application can do.

Interested in the **technical aspects** of this open source system?  Take a
look at the :doc:`short technical presentation <technical_presentation>`
or dive into the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/Ecodev/gims>`_.

The documentation below provides a step by step basic presentation of how
GIMS works as well as detailed chapters for specific users.

.. warning::

    New features are being added into GIMS that necessitate adaptations to
    the current interfaces. Differences between the web application and the
    current documentation are therefore possible.

.. note::

    JMP users only interested in data entry can go directly to the section
    :doc:`How to answer a questionnaire <data_input2>`.
