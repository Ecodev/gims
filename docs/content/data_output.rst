Data dissemination
==================

GIMS has been built not only to facilitate structured and decentralized data
collection and validation as well as its representation and analysis via
tables, graphs and maps, but will also integrate a **dynamic reporting**
feature.

To avoid users having to produce manually dozens or even hundreds of outputs
manually, the system will enable end-users to create a template through which
they can then visualize - as charts, maps and tables with accompanying custom
texts - the results of their survey.

Exporting of charts and maps as svg or pdf files as well as being able to
send an URL the reproduces the exact chart, maps or table generated will
also be implemented.
