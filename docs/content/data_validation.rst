Data validation
===============

The standard data flow goes as follows with the corresponding status of
the questionnaire:

* **new**: initial status required to enter / edit data. This is normally
  done by a :term:`reporter`.
* **completed**: the reporter has finished entering the information and
  is requesting the questionnaire be validated. The person assigned as
  :term:`validator` is automatically notified by email. From this stage on,
  the data can't be modified anymore unless the validator reverts the status
  back to "new".
* **validated**: this status is given to a questionnaire once it has been
  reviewed and the content considered validated. Data is not yet published.
* **published**: this status is required for the data to be accessible to
  everyone via the browse section of GIMS.
* **rejected**: this status is a way of "archiving" data that one doesn't
  want to render visible or take into consideration in calculations, but that
  is kept for historical reasons (a way of knowing this data has been seen
  but that one has decided not to use it).

For the moment, the only complete data validation process used is for GLASS
questionnaires.
